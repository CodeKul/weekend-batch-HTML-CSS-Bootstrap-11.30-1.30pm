<!-- align-content
This property of flex-box aligns flex-lines with respect to each other along the cross-axis.	

This property works only when the “flex-wrap:” property is set to wrap

This property has no effect when the number of flex-line is 1.

The align-content property accepts 6 different values:
flex-start:lines packed to the start of the container
flex-end:lines packed to the end of the container
center:lines packed to the center of the container
space-between:lines evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
space-around:lines evenly distributed with equal space between
stretch(Default):lines stretch to take up the remaining space



align-items

align-items is for items in a single row. So for a single row of elements on the main axis,
align-items will align these items respective of each other and it will start 
with a fresh perspective from the next row.

This property of flex-box aligns the flex-items within flex-line along the cross-axis 

This property works even when the “flex-wrap:” property is not set to wrap 

This property does not depend on the number of flex-lines.

The align-items property accepts 5 different values:
flex-start:cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line
flex-end:cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line
center:items are centered in the cross-axis
baseline:items are aligned such as their baselines align
